<p>So I haven't recorded anything for a long time.</p>
<p>I was playing around with Tracktor 3 and decided to record a mix.&Acirc;&nbsp; First time really doing a digital mix.&Acirc;&nbsp; Needs some work and getting used to.&Acirc;&nbsp; I think I may need to get some timecode CD's so I can have some more physical control.</p>
<p>Here it is:<a title="DJ DeFi - Digital Summer #1" href="http:&#47;&#47;djdefi.com&#47;media&#47;DJ%20DeFi%20-%20Digital%20Summer%20%231.mp3"><br />
<&#47;a></p>
<h3><a href="http:&#47;&#47;djdefy.com&#47;media&#47;DJ%20DeFi%20-%20Digital%20Summer%20%231.mp3">Digital Summer #1<&#47;a><&#47;h3><br />
Named it #1 becuase there may be a #2 and so on soon :P</p>
