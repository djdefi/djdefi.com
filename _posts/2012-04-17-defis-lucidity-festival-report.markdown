<p>So here is the after report from Lucidity Festival:</p>
<p>Friday morning: My set time is 11am, I get up at my normal time for work, 7am. Slowly start getting ready. It is pouring rain, hailing, and lightning and thunder. We leave around 8am in the pouring rain.</p>
<p>Arrive at the festival around 9:15, super muddy parking lot, people huddled in the check in tent. I park, and wade through the mud to the tent, get checked in and am told to contact the stage manager and wait in the lot because they are not letting anyone up the hill, and there is no stages up and running yet. Music was supposedly going to start at 7am Friday.</p>
<p>At about 9:45, I cant get ahold of any of my contacts, so I decide to just try to get past the checkpoint and get into the festival grounds. I tell the security guy I am performing in an hour, and he waves me trough the gate.</p>
<p>Once up inside of the muddy festival grounds, drive past the main and live stages, noticing a lack of music playing. I get up to the Renegade Outpost stage (where I am booked) at 10am, perfect 1 hour early for me set. Only problem, is the speaker stacks are covered up, the DJ booth has no equipment in it (not even a mixer yet) and obviously no sound being played.</p>
<p>I contact the stage manager, and he basically tells me they are holding due to the lightning storm. A huge 50 foot steel dome + lightning storm is something they didn't want to mess with. </p>
<p>So we go and setup our little camp, in the rain. I keep heading back to the stage to see if I have any hope of making my slot... 11am comes and goes, and about 11:45 they get the go ahead and the system comes to life with a little sound check.</p>
<p>Since DJ's were getting bumped before me, they gave me the choice of waiting for a slot on the big renegade stage, or I could go over and spin on the Dirty Beetles Boogaloo Art bus. I agreed to go do the bus, so I was loaded up onto a ATV and shuttled over to the Boogaloo Bus. They were still setting up some Subs and stacks, so I helped as much as I could with putting plastic wrap over the speakers to keep the water out. </p>
<p>After about an hour of setup, I was finally able to get my Traktor S4 plugged in, and got the signal to go ahead and DROP SOME BASS! Started out with Dubstep, as that was what the CD before me was playing. Switched it up into Electro house for a good while. The next DJ came in after about and hour and I asked him if he would be playing faster or slower than my current 128 BPM, he said he was going to be like 70 BPM and in a whole other direction from Electro. </p>
<p>So then I started dropping in moomba, thinking I only had like 2 tracks left. Ended up playing about 10 moomba tracks, double dropping, and getting a good little crowd worked up. Eventually the next DJ said he was ready to go, so I hit up some bouncer EFX and gave him a nice intro build up. About 5 minutes into his set, the Boogaloo bus's power gets cut, and is offline for an hour :(</p>
<p>So we shelter for the rain a bit more, and eventually it lets up enough to venture around the festival and check stuff out, lots of great DJ's and performers that night.</p>
<p>Got a little too tipsy on our vodka &#47; cran &#47; vitamin water jungle juice, and decided it would be a good idea to take a nap before my Silent Disco set at 2:30am. I didn't hear my alarm due to Boogaloo and other sound camps still going on way past the 12am music cutoff. So that kinda sucked, missed my Silent Disco set.</p>
<p>The next morning, about an hour after being awakened at 6am by the BOOMING funkworks Funktion-One sound system, I ventured out to see if the food vendors were open yet. They weren't, so I kinda just wandered around in a daze until my friend, who is helping run the whole festival comes flying at me in an ATV cart thing.</p>
<p>He casually says "hey dude, your spinning at 6pm on the Outpost stage tonight"</p>
<p>I am like - "Oh sh*t" - Totally not expected, but totally awesome. I get loaded up on an ATV to go find one of the other people in charge, and confirm the 6pm set time.</p>
<p>Fast forward through my pumping adrenaline and anxiety the whole rest of the day. Lots of naked people in the Dr. Bronners foam bath and sick beats.</p>
<p>5pm, head to the Renegade Outpost stage, got some dope glitchy dubstep stuff going on. I get into the booth and had the stage managers my outputs. Time ticks down slowly, get my first track, The Quemists - I'm a Renegade, loaded into the deck. Then it is all me. Press play. BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM ~~ I'm a renegade, I'm a rebel, don't worry about me, don't worry about me!!! BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM ~~</p>
<p>So loud, so clean, so many people dancing. Had a pair of hippy dudes get naked and dance &#47; run around the whole area. Was so much energy and good vibes as the sun was setting on us.</p>
<p>The rest of the night was spent watching the amazing fire dancers for hours, and hearing Heyoka and a bunch of other sick DJ's. </p>
<p>The next morning we had to pack up camp and get back to reality a bit early. Lucidity Festival was amazing, can't wait to do it again.</p>
